This is the repository for pylabnet, a software package for client-server, Python-based experiment control, designed for use in solid-state quantum optics and quantum network experiments in the Lukin group.

## Prerequisites

* Supported Python versions: 3.7 - 3.8

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository onto the local machine. For Windows, this will require [git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) to be installed.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukingroup/pylabnet.git
```

2. Navigate into the root directory of the cloned repository:
```bash
cd pylabnet
```

3. (Optional but highly recommended to avoid conflicts with dependencies) Create a virtual environment using the following command:
```bash
python -m venv <env_path>
```
where `<env_path>` is the desired location of the virtual environment. For example, if you want to place the environment in the root level of the `pylabnet` folder and name it `env`, the command would simply be `python -m venv env`.

Activate the development environment using the command:
```bash
<env_path>\Scripts\activate # Windows
. <env_path>/bin/activate   # Linux
```
Be sure to set the interpreter in your IDE to `<env_path>\Scripts\python.exe` (Windows) or `<env_path>/bin/python` (Linux) if you will be launching pylabnet scripts directly from the IDE.

4.  Install all package requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If it fails, try upgrading pip with `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`. Also make sure that your [Python version is supported](#prerequisites).

5. Finally, run the command to install pylabnet:
```bash
python setup.py develop
```

There may be some errors during dependency installation, but as long as the command terminates with output `Finished processing dependencies for pylabnet==x.y.z` the installation has worked.

6. To confirm that the installation has completed, you should be able to run  `import pylabnet` in your scripts, and you should also find the executables `pylabnet_master` and `pylabnet_staticproxy` in the folder `<env_path>\Scripts` (Windows) or `<env_path>/bin` (Linux). Continue reading on to the [initial setup notes](initial-setup-notes) for the initial configuration that needs to be done when setting up a new computer.


## Initial Setup Notes

#### Create SSL key

The package uses SSL authentication via a self-signed private key. You can generate this key using OpenSSL from the command line:
```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out pylabnet.pem -keyout pylabnet.pem
```
You may adjust the value of the `days` flag in order to change the period over which the key is valid. This private key file `pylabnet.pem` should be placed into `C:\Windows\System32` (Windows) or `/etc/ssl/certs` (Linux). On Windows, one of the easiest way to run OpenSSL is using the Git Bash shell that is installed together with Git for Windows.

#### Configuration and environment files 

* Create a configuration file `pylabnet/configs/static_proxy.json` with the following fields:
```
{
    "logger_path": "C:\\pylabnet_logs", # Only required for master logger (i.e. running pylabnet_master)
    "master_ip": "192.168.50.101",      # Only required for logger client (i.e. running pylabnet_staticproxy)
    "master_log_port": 12345,
    "master_gui_port": 12346
}
```
The `master_log_port` and `master_gui_port` are freely chosen by the master logger in its configuration file, and all LogClients will need to specify these same ports in order to conenct to the master logger. LogClients will additionally also need to specify the master logger's IP address in `master_ip`.


* Create an environment file `.env` in the root folder with the following field:
```
LOCALHOST_PW=REMOTE_PC_PASSWORD
```
This is needed to ssh into remote computers and start up device servers for devices that are connected to remote computers. A big limitation of the current approach is that it requires all target remote computers to have the same login password.

* (Optional): Create a configuration file `pylabnet/configs/lab_name.json` with the following field:
```javascript
{
    "lab_name": B16
}
```
This can be used for tagging of servers and filtering of servers by lab. Defaults to "NO LAB" if not specified.

* (Optional): Create a configuration file `pylabnet/configs/network_configuration.json` with the following field:
```javascript
{
    "subnet": "192.168",          # Windows
    "network_interface": "enp0s3" # Linux
}
```
This is used to specify which IP address of the local computer should be used when creating servers in the event that it has more than one (e.g. one IP for the LAN and another IP for the Internet). For Windows, this is done by specifying a prefix that the IP address should satisfy, while for Linux this is done by specifying the network interface that should be used. To check what IP addresses and network interfaces the computer currently has, run the command `ipconfig` on Windows or `ifconfig` on Linux.


#### Windows Firewall

You will likely need to allow Python through Windows Firewall the first time you run Launch Control on a new machine.

## Usage

The main executables used for launching the Launch Control GUI are `pylabnet_master` and `pylabnet_staticproxy` located in the folder `<env_path>\Scripts` (Windows) or `<env_path>/bin` (Linux). If desired, you can create shortcuts for these executables together with the `devices.ico` icon (shown above) for bonus style.

The master Launch Control `pylabnet_master` starts a `LogServer` and also keeps track of all servers on the network, while proxy Launch Control instances simply connect to the master logger and mirror its information for convenience on remote machines. The general workflow for working with Launch Control is the following:

1. Choose a computer to be the master logger. We recommend that this computer be stable with low downtime as all pylabnet communication will require the master logger to be online. Here, launch a master Launch Control using the `pylabnet_master` executable.
2. For all other computers on the network, launch a proxy Launch Control with `pylabnet_staticproxy` to mirror the information that is being recorded on the master logger. This enables the local computer to receive logging messages from all other computers on the network.
3. For each device that you want to connect, a separate configuration JSON file will be required to specify parameters such as the device ID and ssh settings (if the device is located on a remote computer). These config files must be located in `pylabnet/configs/devices/<device_type>/<config_filename>.json`. To start this device server, double click on the config filename in the Devices column of Launch Control. You can then write local scripts that connect to these device servers to interact with the device.
4. For each script that you want to run, a separate configuration JSON file will be required, which minimally specifies the prerequisite device servers and the script location. These config files must be located in `pylabnet/configs/script/<script_type>/<config_filename>.json`. To start this script, double click on the config filename in the Scripts column of Launch Control.
